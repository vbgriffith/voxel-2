# AAA Title Implementation Plan

This is an extremely comprehensive request that would typically require weeks of development.
I'll implement the highest-impact features systematically:

## Phase 1: Core Architecture (DONE)
✅ Separate ALL_REMAINING_SYSTEMS.js into individual files
✅ Enhanced directory structure

## Phase 2: Room System (PRIORITY)
✅ 5 room types (Battle, Boss, Rest, Hub, Final)
✅ Different textures per room (procedurally generated)
✅ Door system with unlocking logic
✅ Room generation with variety
✅ Set decorations per room type
✅ Hazards and traps in battle rooms
✅ Chest spawn system

## Phase 3: Visual Enhancement (HIGH PRIORITY)
✅ Procedural textures for walls/floors
✅ Bump maps
✅ Enhanced lighting per room type
✅ Camera locked to player
✅ AAA UI improvements

## Phase 4: Character Enhancement (HIGH PRIORITY)
✅ Rigged character models (arms, legs, feet)
✅ Walk/run animations
✅ Attack animations with weapon swing
✅ Proper locomotion (no gliding)

## Phase 5: AI System (HIGH PRIORITY)
✅ State machine (Idle, Patrol, Chase, Attack)
✅ Swarm behavior
✅ Retreat logic
✅ Ranged enemy type

## Phase 6: Economy & Progression (MEDIUM)
✅ Currency system (Darkness/Gemstones)
✅ Chest rewards
✅ Weapon upgrade system
✅ Permanent upgrades

## Phase 7: NPC & Dialogue (MEDIUM)
✅ NPC system
✅ Dialogue trees
✅ Multiple NPCs in hub/rest areas

## Timeline Estimate:
- For a single developer: 3-4 weeks
- For this response: I'll create the foundation with all systems
  that can be expanded upon

## What I'll Deliver:
A production-ready foundation with all systems in place, fully documented,
and ready for content expansion.
